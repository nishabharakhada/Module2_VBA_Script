Overview of Project

# In this challenge, the purpose was to provide analysis of the dataset provided for multiple stocks with a one click solution by having predefined criterias.

The purpose and background are well defined (2 pt).

## The purpose was to provide comparative analysis for 2 years data to choose the correct stock for short term or long term investment

Results
The analysis is well described with screenshots and code (4 pt).
The yearly outcome (2017 and 2018) provided the details of the volumes and return on investment each year. 

The total volumes derives that whether the stock is highly traded and the return confirms whether annual % is as per investor's goal?
Also, having the data for more than a year checks the volatility of the market and factors that needed to be included in order to derive teh correct output




Summary
It is challenging for me to completely put advantages and disadvantages for refactoring. 
I understand that when the dataset is large and if the code is not written efficiently then it takes larger amount of time to run th script and may not work when the time is the essence. 
As we all know the value of the stock changes in milliseconds, it is imperative that changes/ refactoring code is important as the outcome needs to be received well within the time to be able to use the same.
